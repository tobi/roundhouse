//! The typed boundary to gems the analyzer does not otherwise model.
//!
//! A gem's public surface is not in the app's tree, but it is often on
//! disk anyway: Tapioca writes one RBI per locked gem under
//! `sorbet/rbi/gems/`. Those files are declarations only -- classes,
//! their ancestry, and `sig`-typed method headers -- which is exactly
//! what a boundary needs and nothing more. This is the table
//! [`crate::ingest::rbi`] reads them into.
//!
//! It is kept apart from `App::rbs_signatures` on purpose. That table
//! is the app's OWN sidecar (`sig/**/*.rbs`) and every consumer of it,
//! the RBS emitters included, treats its entries as things the app
//! declares. A gem's methods are not the app's to declare, so they are
//! carried here and only the analyzer's dispatch registry reads them.
