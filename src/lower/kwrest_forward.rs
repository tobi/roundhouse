//! A forwarded `**` bundle landed in an OPTIONAL KEYWORD's slot instead
//! of the `**rest` slot it was aimed at.
//!
//! ```ruby
//! def local_datetime_tag(datetime, style: :time, **attributes)   # def
//! def message_timestamp(message, **attributes)
//!   local_datetime_tag message.created_at, **attributes          # call
//! ```
//!
//! `ingest::library_class` flattens BOTH keyword forms to positionals —
//! `style:` to a positional-with-default, `**attributes` to a trailing
//! positional defaulting to `{}` — and `ingest::expr` erases the call's
//! `**` into the `merge` chain it is defined to be, which is likewise
//! positional. Each half is individually sound. Together they slide the
//! bundle one slot left:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! def self.local_datetime_tag(datetime, style = :time, attributes = {})
//! TimeHelper.local_datetime_tag(message.created_at, attributes)
//! ```
//!
//! so `style` binds the whole hash and `attributes` binds `{}`. campfire
//! renders `message_timestamp(message, class: "message__timestamp")` as
//!
//! ```html
//! <time datetime="…" data-local-time-target="{class: &quot;message__timestamp&quot;}">
//! ```
//!
//! — the `class` dropped and the `data` attribute carrying an inspected
//! Hash. `lower::kwsplat` states the opposite of this in passing
//! ("`**rest` needs no special case … exactly the shape the desugar is
//! already correct for"); that holds only while the `**rest` slot is the
//! FIRST unfilled one, which an optional keyword beside it is precisely
//! what breaks.
//!
//! ## Why an argument in that slot can only be an erased `**`
//!
//! The same argument `kwsplat` makes from arity, made from position
//! instead. `style:` is a KEYWORD in the source: Ruby offers no way to
//! fill it positionally, so a positional argument sitting there cannot
//! have been written by the app's author. It is ingest's own flattening
//! showing through, and the only thing it can have been is the `**`.
//!
//! That inference needs a fact the flattening destroys, so ingest now
//! records it: [`Param::from_keyword`] and [`Param::from_kwrest`] mark
//! the two flattened shapes. Both are inert in emit — the emitted
//! parameter list is unchanged — and read only here.
//!
//! ## The repair
//!
//! Move the bundle to the `**rest` slot and fill the keyword slots it
//! skipped with the DEFAULTS the callee declared, which is what Ruby
//! does for a keyword the bundle does not carry:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! TimeHelper.local_datetime_tag(message.created_at, :time, attributes)
//! ```
//!
//! ## The guards
//!
//! - **Every skipped slot must be `from_keyword`.** A genuine optional
//!   positional (`def f(a, b = 1, **o)`) CAN be filled positionally in
//!   Ruby, so an argument there says nothing and is left alone.
//! - **Each default must be a literal.** It is re-evaluated in the
//!   CALLER's scope, where `Current.user` or `Time.now` is a different
//!   value than the callee would have computed.
//! - **The bundle must be a bare local, ivar or constant read.** Narrows
//!   to the forwarding shape and keeps this pass off anything an earlier
//!   pass placed: `helper_kwargs` splices literal keywords into these
//!   same slots, which is why it runs AFTER this one.
//! - **The trailing argument must not already be `Hash { kwargs: true }`**
//!   — a literal keyword list, which is `helper_kwargs`' business.
//!
//! The two guards about the ARGUMENT — a non-literal default and a
//! bundle that is not a bare read — LEDGER, on the same reasoning as
//! `kwsplat`: the call really is aimed at the `**rest` slot and really
//! does miss it, so leaving it alone means it still renders the wrong
//! thing. The two about the SLOT return silently, because they are not
//! gaps: a genuine optional positional is one the caller may legally
//! fill, and a literal keyword list already binds correctly through
//! `helper_kwargs`.
//!
//! ## Known divergence
//!
//! A bundle that actually CARRIES one of the named keywords —
//! `message_timestamp(message, style: :date)` — keeps it in the rest
//! hash instead of binding the parameter, so the callee sees the default
//! and the key renders as a stray attribute. Ruby distributes by key at
//! call time; nothing static knows the keys of a hash forwarded through
//! a method boundary. The pre-existing behaviour is wrong for EVERY
//! bundle, this one for the subset that names a keyword, and campfire's
//! two call sites are both in the correct subset.
