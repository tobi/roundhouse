//! `Rooms::Open.count` — an STI SUBCLASS standing at a query root.
//!
//! Rails' single-table inheritance gives a subclass its own default
//! scope: `Rooms::Open.count` counts the rooms whose `type` column says
//! `"Rooms::Open"`, not every row in `rooms`.
//!
//! An STI subclass is not ingested as a Model (it declares no table of
//! its own), so every one of those call sites resolved by plain Ruby
//! inheritance to the BASE class's method and answered the whole table.
//! campfire has seven rooms across three subclasses, so
//! `Rooms::Open.count` answered 7 where Rails answers 2 — a silently
//! wrong number, and the reason `user_test`'s membership-grant assertion
//! could pass while nothing was scoped: it compares that expression
//! against itself.
//!
//! The rewrite is a call-site one, into vocabulary every target already
//! speaks:
//!
//! ```text
//! Rooms::Open.pluck(:id)  ->  Room.where(type: "Rooms::Open").pluck(:id)
//! Rooms::Open.all         ->  Room.where(type: "Rooms::Open")
//! ```
//!
//! Synthesizing per-subclass class methods was the alternative and is
//! worse twice over: the surface is the whole Relation API, and each
//! method would have to land on every target.
//!
//! **`becomes!` is the one place a synthesized class method IS right.**
//! `room.becomes!(Rooms::Open)` recasts a loaded row to an STI sibling,
//! so unlike the relation surface it cannot be expressed by re-rooting
//! the call — the RESULT has to be an instance of the named subclass
//! (campfire's `Rooms::Open#grant_access_to_all_users` is a callback
//! that only exists on the sibling, and only fires if the object is
//! one). The target is always a literal constant at the call site, so
//! no runtime dispatch is needed: the call becomes
//! `Rooms::Open.becomes_from(room)`, and this pass pushes that class
//! method onto the subclass. Its return type is the subclass, which is
//! what keeps `@room = @room.becomes!(Rooms::Closed)` assignable on the
//! strict targets — a shared-runtime instance method could only have
//! returned `ActiveRecord::Base`.
//!
//! The COLUMN COPY is written out here too, one named column at a
//! time, and that placement was paid for: a shared-runtime
//! `Base#becomes_state_from(source)` looping over `source.attributes`
//! compiles on the ruby target and does not exist on Rust, where
//! `Base` is a plain struct and `attributes` lives on each model. The
//! generic loop needs the polymorphic dispatch back to the subclass
//! that the strict targets are built to avoid. Here the schema is
//! known at lowering time, so the loop unrolls into concrete `[]`/`[]=`
//! reads and writes and nothing needs dispatching.
//!
//! **Two halves.** The RELATION surface filters; the CONSTRUCTORS
//! (`new`/`create!`/…) STAMP, folding `type: "Rooms::Open"` into the
//! attribute hash — without it `Rooms::Open.create!` wrote a row
//! belonging to no subclass, which the read half above then correctly
//! could not see. A hand-written class method on the subclass
//! (`Rooms::Direct.find_or_create_for`) is the subclass's own; and
//! `find` is left alone because the arel pass inlines `<Model>.find` to
//! a primary-key SELECT — re-rooting it would move that work onto the
//! Relation path for no scoping gain a primary key can use.
