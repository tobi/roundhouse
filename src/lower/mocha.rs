//! mocha, lowered to a typed stub slot.
//!
//! `Resolv.stubs(:getaddresses).with("h").returns([ip])` is a runtime
//! method-table swap. There is no method table to swap on a strict
//! target, and mocha is a Ruby metaprogramming library with nothing to
//! compile against — so campfire's stubbing tests were a PERMANENT
//! ceiling, ledgered as "nothing to fix until those gems have a spinel
//! surface".
//!
//! They are not, because the set of stub sites is CLOSED at transpile
//! time. This is the same argument that licensed monomorphizing
//! `lower::class_body_new`: an ingested tree's stubs are all visible
//! here, so a copy-and-bind is available where late binding is not.
//!
//! WHAT THE CORPUS ACTUALLY ASKS FOR. Measured across campfire's suite
//! before designing anything — 43 sites, and 41 of 42 stub a CLASS-SIDE
//! method on a statically-known constant:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Resolv.getaddresses            13     WebPush.payload_send        11
//!   TCPSocket.open                  8     SecureRandom.alphanumeric    4
//!   Turbo::StreamsChannel.*         4     Random.uuid                  1
//!   Webhook.any_instance.post       1   (the only instance-level one)
//! ```
//!
//! So the lowering does not need a general mocha. It needs a rule table
//! keyed by (constant, method), which is what `STUBBABLE` is — adding
//! `WebPush.payload_send` is a row plus a slot on the facade, not new
//! code here.
//!
//! WHY A FACADE SLOT RATHER THAN `self.new`-STYLE INDIRECTION. Most of
//! these are methods on OUR OWN runtime shims, and `GemFacade.fail!` is
//! already the single point where "there is no real implementation"
//! gets decided. A stub slot belongs exactly there: with one installed
//! the facade answers it, with none it fails as loudly as before. The
//! seam costs one comparison on a table seeded with a sentinel.
//!
//! IT RUNS ON EVERY TARGET, INCLUDING CRuby. A lowering may not branch
//! on the target, so the ruby family gets the same rewrite — and
//! therefore the same slot, bolted onto the stdlib class by
//! `project::RESOLV_STUB_REOPEN`. That is a deliberate trade: those
//! sites stop exercising real mocha under CRuby and start exercising
//! the same slot every other target uses, which is the parity this
//! pipeline is for.
//!
//! WHAT A CHAIN THIS PASS DOES NOT SERVE BECOMES. It used to be left
//! spelled as mocha, which is loud in the right place under CRuby (real
//! mocha) and loud in the WRONG place on a strict target: `stubs` is a
//! frontend refusal there, so one unserved chain took its whole FILE off
//! the compiled lane — `push_subscription_test`, 17 tests, for one
//! `.with { |*| … }` block predicate most of them never reach. Now every
//! recognised chain the table cannot serve is handed to `MochaBridge.
//! chain(...)` AS DATA: the constant by name, the kind, the method, the
//! ops list, and the `with` block if there was one. The file that
//! defines the bridge is per target (`project.rs`): the ruby family
//! REPLAYS it through the real gem, so nothing those lanes passed
//! changes; a strict target raises, per test, at the call. Same for a
//! bare structural matcher (`has_entry(...)`) — `MochaBridge.matcher`.
//!
//! `expects` is served for the rows that declare a count slot:
//! `.never`/`.once`/`.twice`/`.times(n)` (and a bare `expects`, which
//! mocha reads as once) become `<Const>.expect_<m>(n)`, and the helper's
//! teardown runs each row's verify, which raises on a mismatch the way
//! `mocha_verify` does — a failure of THAT test.
//!
//! THE APP'S OWN METHODS are the one shape the table cannot hold a row
//! for: `@membership.user.expects :reset_remote_connections`,
//! `Webhook.any_instance.stubs(:post).raises(Net::OpenTimeout)`. The
//! same closed-set argument applies, so the METHOD gets the slot. The
//! chain becomes a `MochaStub` (runtime/spinel/mocha_stub.rb) parked on
//! the instance (`user.__mocha_reset_remote_connections = …`, for an
//! object head whose static type names an app model) or filed by
//! "Klass#m" in the runtime's registry (for `any_instance`), and
//! `guard_app_methods` prepends to the lowered method a check that asks
//! for the stub first and, when one is in force, records the call,
//! raises the class the chains named (one arm per class, spelled as the
//! constant), and returns nil in place of the body — mocha's
//! replacement. Served: a bare `expects`, `.never`/`.once`/`.twice`/
//! `.times(n)`, `.raises(E)`; a `.returns(v)` or a `.with` would widen
//! the app method's return type or need argument matching, and goes to
//! the bridge (an instance head with no app-model type is left as
//! written).
