//! Target-neutral lowering of Turbo Streams broadcast declarations.
//!
//! Walks a model's body looking for two shapes:
//!
//!   1. `broadcasts_to ->(record) { "stream" }, inserts_by: :prepend`
//!      — fires on every save (replace / prepend / append) and every
//!      destroy (remove). The lambda param is preserved as
//!      `self_param` so each emitter can rewrite it to its own
//!      `self` / `this` / `record` convention when rendering.
//!   2. `after_create_commit { assoc.broadcast_replace_to("stream") }`
//!      and `after_destroy_commit { ... }` — fires on a parent
//!      record found via a belongs_to association. The association
//!      is resolved here so emitters can render the guarded lookup
//!      (`<Target>::find(self.<fk>)` and friends) without
//!      re-walking the body.
//!
//! Expressions inside the declarations (channel name, target
//! override, broadcast args) stay as dialect-level `Expr` nodes —
//! rendering to target syntax is the emitter's job. The
//! `rescue nil` modifier on `after_*_commit` blocks (used by the
//! blog fixture during seeding) is peeled here so emitters see just
//! the underlying broadcast call.
