//! A bare `new` in a CLASS BODY is the class's own constructor.
//!
//! `self` in a class body — and in a `def self.` method — is the class,
//! so Ruby reads `new(name: "bell")` there as `Sound.new(name: "bell")`.
//! campfire's `Sound::BUILTIN` is fifty-six of them in one array
//! literal, and the emit replayed the bare spelling:
//!
//! ```text
//! app/models/sound.rb:39: unsupported call:
//!   node 95214 (CallNode `new`) recv=-/ty-1 argc=1 arg0ty28
//! ```
//!
//! A receiverless call has no receiver to resolve against, and `new`
//! is not a free function anywhere. The same array with the receiver
//! spelled out compiles and runs on spinel today (probed), which is
//! what makes this ours rather than a compiler gap.
//!
//! Scoped to the two positions where implicit self IS the class:
//! class-body constant initializers (they run at load time, in the
//! class body) and class-side method bodies. An INSTANCE method's bare
//! `new` is a NoMethodError in Ruby too, so there is nothing there to
//! preserve.
//!
//! AND `self` IS NOT ALWAYS THE OWNER. In a class-side method that a
//! subclass INHERITS, `self` at call time is the subclass — that is the
//! whole point of the class-side template method:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! class ActionText::Content::Filter          # campfire, rails_ext/filter.rb
//!   class << self
//!     def apply(content)
//!       filter = new(content)                # `self` is the SUBCLASS
//!       filter.applicable? ? ... : content
//!     end
//!   end
//!   def applicable? = raise NotImplementedError
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! Binding that to the owner made every `ContentFilters::*.apply` build
//! the ABSTRACT BASE, whose `applicable?` raises — and campfire wraps
//! the filter chain in its own `rescue Exception` returning `""`, so
//! every message body rendered EMPTY behind a 200 and a green suite.
//! `scripts/campfire-cable-walk` is what found it.
//!
//! So a class-side method on a class the tree SUBCLASSES is
//! MONOMORPHIZED: a copy lands in every descendant that does not define
//! the name itself, each copy's `new` bound to the class it now lives
//! in, and the original keeps the owner. `Filter.apply` builds a
//! `Filter`; `SanitizeAttributes.apply` builds a `SanitizeAttributes`;
//! neither needs a dispatch at run time.
//!
//! WHY NOT `self.new`, WHICH IS WHAT THE SOURCE SAYS. It was tried, and
//! it is one arity short on spinel: `self.new` with NO arguments
//! compiles and dispatches to the receiver, `self.new(x)` is
//! `unsupported call: CallNode 'new' recv=SelfNode` (filed upstream).
//! Beyond that gap the shape is the wrong one for this pipeline anyway
//! — a class-side virtual call is exactly what the strict targets have
//! no vtable for, and a lowering may not branch on the target. The
//! subclass set of an ingested tree is CLOSED and known here, which is
//! what makes copying available where late binding is not.
//!
//! It costs a copy of the method per descendant. The whole corpus has
//! ONE site (`ActionText::Content::Filter.apply`, four descendants), so
//! the bound is measured rather than assumed — and if a class ever
//! turns up with a large class-side method and many subclasses, this is
//! the pass that will say so.
//!
//! Only `new`. `create` / `create!` are the same shape on a MODEL class
//! body, but they are also association-scope constructors that
//! `lower::scope_chain` already claims at implicit self
//! (`SELF_CONSTRUCTORS`), and no corpus app writes one in a constant.
//! When one does, it belongs beside this — not in a second walk.
