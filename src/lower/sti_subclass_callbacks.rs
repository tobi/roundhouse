//! What an STI SUBCLASS needs that the model path gives a model:
//! its callbacks, and the inheritance-column stamp on `new`.
//!
//! `class Rooms::Open < Room; after_save_commit :grant_access_to_all_users; end`
//!
//! An STI subclass declares no table of its own, so it is not ingested
//! as a Model ([`super::sti_scope`] documents that choice and what else
//! follows from it) — it reaches the IR as a `LibraryClass`, and the
//! callback-to-hook synthesis in `model_to_library::markers` walks
//! `app.models`. The declaration therefore landed in `unknown_calls`,
//! preserved and never acted on: the method was emitted and nothing
//! ever called it. campfire's two `Rooms::Open` tests both assert on
//! what that callback grants, and both read `assert_equal failed` with
//! no memberships in the table.
//!
//! The fold is the same one the model path uses — a self-call appended
//! to the hook method of the same name — and it works for a subclass
//! for the reason Ruby dispatch works: `Model.create!` builds through
//! `new(attrs)` at implicit self, so `Rooms::Open.create!` really does
//! produce a `Rooms::Open`, and the runtime's `save_after_validation`
//! finds the subclass's override.
//!
//! ONLY the bare symbol form. An `if:`/`unless:`/`on:` option is
//! declined rather than dropped, matching `push_symbol_callback`'s
//! `condition.is_some()` early return: a callback that runs in the
//! wrong circumstances is worse than one that does not run, and a
//! declined declaration stays visible in `unknown_calls`.
//!
//! ## The type stamp
//!
//! The same "not a Model, so the model path skipped it" fact, one step
//! further along. Rails' `ensure_proper_type` writes the class name
//! into the inheritance column when a SUBCLASS is instantiated; ours
//! did not, so a room created through the base class's own `create_for`
//! — `Rooms::Open.create_for` reaches `Base.create!`, whose
//! `new(attrs)` is at implicit self and so really does build a
//! `Rooms::Open` — went to the database with a BLANK type. Two silent
//! consequences: `Rooms::Open.all` (`where(type: "Rooms::Open")`) did
//! not find it, and `after_save_commit :grant_access_to_all_users` —
//! the callback the half above just connected — is guarded on
//! `type_previously_changed?(to: "Rooms::Open")`, so the new room
//! granted membership to its creator and nobody else.
