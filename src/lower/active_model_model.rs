//! `include ActiveModel::Model` on a plain class — synthesized, not
//! provided.
//!
//! Rails' `ActiveModel::Model` (an alias for `ActiveModel::API`) mixes
//! six modules into a class that has no table: attribute assignment,
//! validations, conversion, naming, translation, access. Almost all of
//! that is machinery for something else; what a class *including* it
//! actually gains, at the call sites our corpus has, is three methods:
//!
//!   * `initialize(attributes = {})` — assign each key through the
//!     matching public writer;
//!   * `valid?` — run the declared validations (none, in a class that
//!     declares none, so: `true`);
//!   * `persisted?` — `false`, the whole point of a tableless model.
//!
//! Two ways to give a class those. Ship `ActiveModel::Model` as a
//! runtime module and leave the `include` standing, or synthesize the
//! three methods into the class and drop the `include`. This pass does
//! the second, because the runtime module can only assign through
//! `public_send("#{name}=", value)` — a dispatch on a computed name,
//! which the CRuby overlay serves and no strict target can. The
//! synthesized form names each ivar literally, so every target compiles
//! it, and the emitted class says what it got instead of pointing at a
//! module the reader has to go read.
//!
//! The writer list IS the contract, not a convenience: Rails assigns
//! through public writers and raises `UnknownAttributeError` for a key
//! with none, so a class's `attr_accessor`/`attr_writer` surface (which
//! ingest has already lowered to `AttributeWriter` methods) is exactly
//! the set of keys `new` accepts.
//!
//! WHY LIBRARY CLASSES ONLY. A superclass-less class under
//! `app/models/` that includes this is classified `ClassKind::Model` at
//! ingest (`library_class::includes_active_model`) and rides the
//! tableless-model path, which lowers its `validates` DSL into a real
//! `valid?`/`errors` pair. That path is strictly better and already
//! exists; this one covers the classes it cannot see — campfire's
//! `ActionText::Attachment::OpengraphEmbed` lives in `lib/rails_ext/`,
//! so it is a library class no matter what it includes, and the
//! surviving `include` was a `NameError` at load time.
//!
//! DECLINES, each with a `lower_residue` entry naming the reason:
//!   * the class defines its own `initialize` — Rails' would be
//!     overridden anyway, but then `valid?`/`persisted?` are the only
//!     gain and dropping the `include` silently would be a guess about
//!     what else the module was there for;
//!   * the class declares a validation (`validate` method or a
//!     `validates` class-body call) — a synthesized `valid? => true`
//!     would answer *yes* for a record the app wrote rules to reject,
//!     which is the one failure mode worth refusing outright;
//!   * the class has no attribute writers — nothing to assign, so the
//!     `include` is doing something this pass does not model.
