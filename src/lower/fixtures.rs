//! Target-neutral fixture-loading lowering.
//!
//! Resolves every YAML fixture record into a structured plan:
//! which class it becomes, which columns receive literals, and which
//! columns are foreign-key references to another fixture's eventual
//! AUTOINCREMENT rowid. Per-target emitters consume the plan to
//! render `_load_all()` bodies + labeled getters in their own syntax.
//!
//! The lowering does NOT embed any persistence or runtime surface —
//! it only describes *what* goes into each INSERT, not *how* the
//! target wraps it. The Rust emitter wraps it in `article.save()`
//! plus a thread-local id map; Python might use sqlite3 directly;
//! Crystal might emit DB.exec. That's per-target.
