//! Rails-API broadcast calls in ORDINARY method bodies.
//!
//! `after_create_commit { article.broadcast_replace_to … }` — a broadcast
//! written inside a callback block — is rewritten where callbacks are
//! synthesized (`model_to_library::markers`). campfire writes its
//! broadcasts the other way: plain methods on a concern,
//!
//! ```text
//! module Message::Broadcasts
//!   def broadcast_create
//!     broadcast_append_to room, :messages, target: [ room, :messages ]
//!   end
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! which no callback walk ever visits. This pass covers both homes those
//! methods can have — a model's own body, and a CONCERN MODULE emitted
//! beside it.
//!
//! The concern half is the reason this is a pass rather than another hook
//! inside `model_to_library`: `Message::Broadcasts` is a library class,
//! not a model, so the rewrite has to resolve its owner (`Message`) from
//! the qualified name to know which associations exist and whose partial
//! the payload renders. A concern nested under a model can only belong to
//! that model — the lexical nesting IS the ownership, which
//! `qualify_relative_includes` already relies on.
