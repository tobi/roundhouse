//! Per-thread source-file registry: the `FileId` ↔ (path, text) table
//! behind real `Span`s.
//!
//! Ingest is a deep recursive descent (`ingest_expr` alone recurses
//! through every expression node), so threading a registry handle
//! through every signature would touch hundreds of call sites for a
//! value consulted only at `Span` construction. Instead the table
//! lives in a thread-local — the same idiom survey mode and the emit
//! diagnostic sink already use.
//!
//! Lifecycle: [`crate::ingest::app::ingest_app_with_vfs`] calls
//! [`reset`] on entry, each per-file ingester [`register`]s the text
//! it actually parses on the way in, and the walker [`drain`]s the
//! table into `App::sources` on the way out. `FileId`s are 1-based —
//! `FileId(0)` stays the synthetic sentinel (`Span::synthetic`).
//!
//! Registration records the text spans index. For plain Ruby that's
//! the text prism parsed; for `.html.erb` views it's the raw template
//! — view ingest registers the template first (first-text-wins), then
//! translates the compiled-Ruby spans back to template offsets via
//! `erb::translate_spans`, so view diagnostics report real template
//! lines and columns.
//!
//! Standalone ingest entry points (unit tests calling
//! `ingest_ruby_program` directly) also register; without a
//! surrounding `reset`/`drain` the table just accumulates on the test
//! thread, which is harmless. Re-registering a path keeps the first
//! text — ids stay stable for spans already handed out.
//!
//! A label starting with `<` (`"<delegate>"`, `"<channel>"`, …) never
//! gets a slot: [`register`] refuses it outright, returning the
//! synthetic `FileId(0)`. Those labels mark synthesized Ruby that a
//! lowering pass (`ingest::delegate` and its siblings) re-ingests to
//! expand a macro into real methods — text that was never in the app
//! and has no stable place in `App::sources`. Registering one anyway
//! is how a synthesized parse failure once rendered against an
//! unrelated real file: [`ingest_app_with_vfs`][super::app::ingest_app_with_vfs]
//! takes one [`snapshot`] mid-ingest (for a pass that needs to read the
//! app's real source text before the synthesizing passes run) and one
//! real [`drain`] at the end; a real file registered in between would
//! be safe either way, but a synthesized one that slipped past its own
//! `prism::scope` isolation would have collided with a fresh low
//! `FileId` once the table's next drain emptied out from under it.
//! This refusal is the backstop for that case — it holds regardless of
//! ordering.
