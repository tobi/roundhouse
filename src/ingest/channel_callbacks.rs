//! `on_subscribe :present, unless: :subscription_rejected?` → a real
//! `after_subscribe` method on the channel.
//!
//! Action Cable's `Channel::Base` includes `ActiveSupport::Callbacks` and
//! declares `after_subscribe` (aliased `on_subscribe`) and
//! `after_unsubscribe` (aliased `on_unsubscribe`). The declaration is a
//! class-body macro whose effect is a callback chain the framework runs
//! around `subscribed`/`unsubscribed`; nothing about that survives into a
//! tree with no `ActiveSupport::Callbacks`, so the call landed in
//! `unknown_calls` and was dropped with a `lower_residue` warning.
//!
//! It is not a nicety. campfire's `PresenceChannel` does ALL of its work
//! in those two hooks — `on_subscribe :present` is the `memberships`
//! UPDATE that records a user as being in a room, and
//! `on_unsubscribe :absent` is the one that takes them out again. A
//! channel that ran `subscribed` and neither hook subscribed correctly
//! and wrote nothing, which is invisible in a functional walk (every
//! frame still arrives) and is precisely the cost a connect-storm
//! benchmark exists to measure. The cable sweep found it by measuring
//! the two lanes against each other: Rails wrote a row per socket and
//! the binary wrote none.
//!
//! ## What it becomes
//!
//! One generated method per hook, guards inlined, callbacks in
//! declaration order:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! def after_subscribe
//!   if !subscription_rejected?
//!     present
//!   end
//!   nil
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! A method and not a table, for the reason every lowering here prefers
//! one: the strict targets resolve calls statically, so a chain walked at
//! run time would be a list of Symbols nothing can dispatch. The runtime
//! base declares both names as no-ops and the dispatcher calls them
//! unconditionally — the same shape `subscribed` already has.
//!
//! ## Inheritance is INLINED, not `super`
//!
//! Rails' callback chains inherit: a hook declared on a parent channel
//! runs for the child too, parent first. Rather than emit `super` — which
//! would need the parent to have a generated method and would put a
//! virtual call on the strict targets' path — an ancestor's callbacks are
//! copied into the child's method ahead of its own. Same order, same
//! effect, one resolvable body.
//!
//! ## The channel's NAME is a literal too
//!
//! `stream_for record` subscribes to `broadcasting_for(record)` =
//! `"#{channel_name}:#{record.to_gid_param}"`, and Action Cable spells
//! `channel_name` off the class (`name.sub(/Channel$/, "").gsub("::",
//! ":").underscore`). Inside `Channel::Base#stream_for` that is
//! `self.class` — the one dynamic read a strict target resolves to the
//! class the method is WRITTEN on: on spinel every channel's `stream_for
//! @room` registered `action_cable:channel:base:<gid>`, one shared name
//! for every channel, which is exactly the collision `channel_name`
//! exists to prevent. Invisible on the server while nothing broadcasts
//! to a channel by name; campfire's own `assert_has_stream_for room`
//! found it on the compiled lane. So every channel gets
//! `def channel_name; "presence"; end` — a compile-time fact baked in,
//! the same rule `lower::broadcasts::push_to_gid_param` states for the
//! model name — and the runtime base reads the instance method.
