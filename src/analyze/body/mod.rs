//! Body-typer: the Rails-agnostic core of type inference.
//!
//! Given an [`Expr`] + a [`Ctx`] + a method dispatch table (a
//! `HashMap<ClassId, ClassInfo>`), walks the tree and annotates each
//! node's `ty` field. This module knows nothing about schemas,
//! controllers, `before_action` chains, or any other Rails dialect —
//! it's pure "Ruby body type inference against known signatures."
//!
//! The Rails-aware [`super::Analyzer`] pre-computes the dispatch
//! table from `App.models` and then threads a [`BodyTyper`] over each
//! method body, action body, and view body.
//!
//! Runtime-extraction code (src/runtime_src.rs) uses the same
//! [`BodyTyper`] with a simpler dispatch table (no user classes, just
//! the primitive method tables).
