//! Thread-local diagnostic sink for the emit path.
//!
//! Emit's `emit_expr`/`emit_send`/`emit_body` functions are pure
//! `fn(&Expr) -> String` and recurse deeply, so threading a
//! `&mut Vec<Diagnostic>` through every signature would touch hundreds
//! of call sites for a value used only at the rare coverage-gap arms.
//! Instead we collect through a thread-local — the same idiom the
//! runtime emit already uses for validation errors and the response
//! object.
//!
//! The lifecycle is scope-based: [`scope`] installs a fresh buffer for
//! the duration of one transpile (saving/restoring any outer buffer so
//! nested or sequential transpiles don't bleed into each other), runs
//! the closure, and returns the collected diagnostics alongside the
//! result. Outside any active scope, [`push`] is a no-op — a catch-all
//! arm still emits its `raise` stub, the diagnostic is simply not
//! retained. Phase 3 wraps the top-level emit drivers in [`scope`] so
//! real runs surface the whole inventory.
//!
//! [`report_unsupported`] is the one-call helper the catch-alls invoke:
//! it pushes a [`Diagnostic::unsupported`] *and* returns the
//! target-appropriate `raise`/`panic`/`throw` stub string, so a gap
//! both self-reports and degrades to a runtime raise at that single
//! site (reusing the existing `Expr.diagnostic → raise` semantics).
