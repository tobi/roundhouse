# Keyed-digest primitives for the spinel binary — the sp_crypto half of
# the two-layer split (message_digest_cruby.rb is the OpenSSL half, and
# `ruby_runtime_files` swaps it in at this path for the CRuby/JRuby
# trees). The framework Ruby above this — action_controller/
# message_verifier.rb — calls only the three functions below and so
# compiles unchanged for every ruby-family target.
#
# sp_crypto ships with spinel (lib/sp_crypto.c, always linked). Two of
# the three entry points landed for exactly this use — reading a Rails
# signed cookie — in matz/spinel#3770 (merged 2026-08-10, spinel
# 6fa33d8c), filed as matz/spinel#3769:
#
#   * `_len` on PBKDF2, because Rails derives at dkLen 64 and the one-
#     block helper topped out at 32.
#   * HMAC-SHA1 at all, because that is the digest Rails signs cookies
#     with, and SHA-1 was previously exposed only as a whole-protocol
#     helper (the WebSocket handshake).
#
# Static-buffer contract: every sp_crypto return points at a per-function
# static that the next call to the same function clobbers, so each result
# is copied (`+ ""`) before it can outlive the next call.

  # sp_crypto returns the derived key base64url-encoded; the callers want
  # the raw bytes (an HMAC key is bytes), so decode on the way out — in
  # Ruby, NOT through `sp_crypto_b64url_decode`. That one hands back a
  # C string with no length, so a key with a zero byte in it arrived cut
  # at the zero: about one SECRET_KEY_BASE in five derives such a key, and
  # on those deployments every signed cookie, signed id, sgid and blob URL
  # the binary made was signed with a key a few bytes long — forgeable,
  # and matching nothing Rails signs. (HMAC itself is binary-safe: it
  # reads the key's length off the String, `sp_str_byte_len`.) Found by
  # running Rails' vectors on the binary; pinned by the `nul_key` cases in
  # tests/rails_compat_vectors_spinel.rs, secrets whose keys hold a zero.
  # The FFI declaration is gone with it, so nothing reaches for it again.
