# A mocha stub or expectation on an APP method — the half of mocha
# `lower::mocha`'s table cannot hold a row for, because the method is
# the app's own (`Webhook#post`, `User#reset_remote_connections`), not a
# runtime constant's.
#
# The set of such stubs is closed at transpile time, so the lowering
# gives the METHOD the slot: a `MochaStub` parked on the instance
# (`user.__mocha_reset_remote_connections = MochaStub.expect(...)`, for
# `obj.expects(:m)`) or filed here under the method's name (for
# `Klass.any_instance.stubs(:m)`), and a guard prepended to the lowered
# method that asks for the stub first and, when one is in force, records
# the call, raises what the stub raises, and returns nil in place of the
# body — which is what mocha's replacement does. Same rewrite on every
# lane; the ruby family stops exercising the gem for these shapes and
# runs the slot every other target runs, the parity `lower::mocha` is
# for.
#
# Required by both production boots, because the guards it serves are in
# app code (with nothing filed, a guard finds nil and runs the real body);
# the test helper also clears the registry in setup and verifies every
# filed expectation in teardown — the same moment, and the same failure,
# as `mocha_verify`.
