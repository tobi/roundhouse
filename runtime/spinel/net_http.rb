# Net::HTTP, reopened over spinel's bundled `packages/net` so the stub
# table (`runtime/http_stub.rb`) is consulted BEFORE any socket opens.
#
# THE RUBY FAMILY NEVER LOADS THIS FILE. `project::ruby_runtime_files`
# swaps it for a bare `require "net/http"`: over there the real WebMock
# gem intercepts CRuby's own client, and a second `Net::HTTP` beside it
# would be a reopen of the wrong class. Same arrangement as `resolv.rb`.
#
# WHY A REOPEN AND NOT A SEPARATE DOUBLE. `Opengraph::Fetch` and
# `Webhook` are written against `Net::HTTP` by name — `Net::HTTP.start`,
# `Net::HTTP::Get.new`, `is_a?(Net::HTTPRedirection)`, `rescue
# Net::OpenTimeout` — so the double has to BE that constant. Reopening
# the package's class keeps every one of those names real (the response
# hierarchy in particular: `is_a?` on a bare struct answers nothing),
# and keeps the real transport reachable for a request no stub answers.
# Webhook delivery works on the spinel binary today through this
# class; a double that replaced it would have taken that away.
#
# WHAT IS REDEFINED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT.
#
# `#request` carries the stub lookup. It does NOT (yet) gain the block
# form the package lacks (matz/spinel#4420; measured 2026-09-10:
# `http.request(req) { |res| }` compiled and the block never ran — no
# error, no warning — so campfire's unfurl spun through MAX_REDIRECTS
# and raised TooManyRedirectsError): see the note on the method for
# what a yielding `request` cost the block-less callers.
#
# `#start` (the INSTANCE method) becomes lazy: it marks the client
# started and opens nothing. The package's `self.start` connects
# eagerly — `http.start` runs BEFORE the block is yielded — which would
# put a real TLS connect to www.example.com ahead of any stub. Deferring
# the connect to the first request that no stub answers is what puts
# the double above the transport.
#
# `self.start` is NOT redefined, and `ipaddr:` — the keyword campfire's
# DNS-rebinding pin is written on — is the PACKAGE's to honour: since
# matz/spinel#4420 closed (2026-09-10) `Net::HTTP.start` declares it and
# `open_connection` connects to it while `Host:` and the TLS name stay
# `address`. Probed 2026-09-17: `Net::HTTP.start("example.com", 80,
# ipaddr: "127.0.0.1")` from a spinel binary fails with ECONNREFUSED on
# 127.0.0.1, exactly as CRuby does, so the pin holds on this lane. The
# TEST's proof of it — `TCPSocket.expects(:open).with { … }.throws` —
# is served by `connect_with_timeout` below asking `TcpSocketStub` about
# the address it is about to connect to, which is where CRuby's mocha
# would have intercepted `TCPSocket.open`. (#4416 and #4419, the
# reopened-yielding-class-method and dropped-keyword bugs this comment
# used to describe, closed the same day.)
#
# Last definition wins under spinel, and a redefined method sees the
# class's other methods and ivars — `transport_request` below is the
# package's `#request` body re-stated over `open_connection`/`reconnect`/
# `write_request`/`read_response`, which this file leaves alone.

    # `request` left `http.request(post)` there with no arm at all:
    # `undefined method 'request' for an instance of Net::HTTP` in all
    # four delivery tests. A `&blk` parameter keeps the standalone
    # entry, so the block-less webhook call and `Opengraph::Fetch`'s
    # `request(req) { |res| … }` dispatch to the same method. The
