module ActiveRecord
  # A lazy, chainable query builder — the metaprogramming-free analog of
  # ActiveRecord::Relation. Lowered model code drives it: `scope`s become
  # class methods that take/return a Relation, associations return one,
  # and a query chain (`Model.where(...).order(...).limit(...)`) is a
  # sequence of Relation method calls that only touches the database at a
  # terminal (`to_a`/`each`/`first`/`count`/…).
  #
  # No `method_missing`, no `define_method`: every method is written out.
  # The model is held as a plain class-object value (`@model`) whose
  # `_table_sql` / `instantiate` class methods supply the per-model facts;
  # calling them is ordinary dispatch.
  #
  # Database access and value escaping go through `ActiveRecord.adapter`
  # (the `AdapterInterface`) rather than the raw `Db` primitive, so the
  # whole class types against the same adapter contract `Base` uses — no
  # target-specific surface leaks in here. Chain methods mutate and return
  # `self`; lowered chains are linear (build then terminate), so a fresh
  # Relation per chain start is enough isolation.
  #
  # Terminals memoize: the first `to_a` loads and caches the records
  # (Rails' loaded-relation contract), so `map` + `each` + `empty?` on
  # the same relation hit the database once, not once per call — and
  # record mutations made between terminals (lobsters' current_vote
  # stamping) survive to the render. Every chain method drops the cache:
  # app code does re-chain after a terminal (`rel = rel.where(...)`
  # returns this same object, mutated), and a stale cache there would
  # serve the pre-refinement rows.
