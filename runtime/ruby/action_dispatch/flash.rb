module ActionDispatch
  # Per-app flash store. Typed-field replacement for HashWithIndifferent-
  # Access in `@flash`. The field set (`notice`, `alert`) is the closed
  # set of keys the lowerer recognizes (see view_to_library/extra_params.rs
  # `is_flash_name`). Apps that introduce new flash keys grow this struct
  # in lockstep with the lowerer.
  #
  # Typed targets (TS/Crystal/Rust) get dot-syntax field access AND the
  # HWIA-shape shim methods (`fetch`, `key?`, `length`, `[]`, `[]=`, …)
  # so framework tests and controller bodies that reach in via the
  # Symbol-keyed bracket form keep compiling. The shim's `[]/[]=` route
  # through a closed `key.to_s` case so the typer doesn't fan the
  # receiver across an untyped Hash channel.
  class Flash
    attr_accessor :notice, :alert
    # Read-only accessors so typed targets infer `String?` for the
    # snapshot ivars via the same accessor-nilability path as
    # notice/alert (bare ivars get a narrower inference).
    attr_reader :notice_was, :alert_was

    # `other` is an optional plain Hash carrying flash state across
    # requests (the server persists flash between redirect_to and the
    # follow-on GET). Nil at first-request boundary; populated on
    # follow-on requests. Keys read as Strings — the server's
    # persistent store is String-keyed.
    #
    # Flash lifecycle (the Rails "show exactly once" rule, owned here so
    # every target's server is just a storage adapter): the constructor
    # snapshots the loaded values as `@notice_was` / `@alert_was`. A key
    # is carried to the next request by `to_persisted` only if the action
    # CHANGED it from that snapshot (i.e. set a new flash this request);
    # a key merely loaded-and-displayed is unchanged, so it drops out and
    # the notice shows exactly once. (The snapshot comparison, rather than
    # hooking `[]=`, is deliberate: typed targets reach the fields
    # natively — `flash["notice"] = x` is a direct field write in TS, not
    # a `[]=` method call — so freshness can't live in `[]=`.)
