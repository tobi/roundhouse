# ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier, reproduced at the wire level.
#
# This exists so a signed cookie the emitted app mints is one the
# reference Rails accepts, and vice versa. That matters twice: the
# differential test boots both and sends one cookie to each, and a real
# migration keeps every session and every signed id already in the wild
# (campfire puts `signed_id`s in URLs — `avatar_token` on every message).
#
# The format, measured against ActiveSupport 8.2 rather than inferred:
#
#   cookie  = strict_base64(envelope) + "--" + hex_digest
#   digest  = HMAC(derived_key, strict_base64(envelope))
#   key     = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(secret_key_base, salt, 1_000, 64)
#
# TWO ENVELOPES, and which one a caller gets depends on its verifier's
# serializer rather than on anything the caller says:
#
#   signed cookie  {"_rails":{"message":<strict_base64(json)>,"exp":null,
#                             "pur":"cookie.<name>"}}
#   signed id      {"_rails":{"data":<json>,"pur":"<model>/<purpose>"}}
#                  {"_rails":{"data":<json>,"exp":"<iso8601_ms>",
#                             "pur":"<model>/<purpose>"}}
#   signed gid     {"_rails":{"data":"gid://<app>/<Model>/<id>?expires_in",
#                             "pur":"attachable"}}
#
# and they are base64'd differently too: a cookie is strict base64, a
# signed id is URL-safe and unpadded (the verifier is `url_safe` because
# the token goes in a path segment), a signed GlobalID is URL-safe and
# PADDED (`GlobalID::Verifier` overrides `encode` with the default
# `urlsafe_encode64`) — see `gid_envelope` for the measurement.
#
# The cookie jar hands its verifier an already-serialized String, so
# `Messages::Metadata` cannot nest the metadata inside the payload and
# base64s it into a `message` field with an always-present `exp`. The
# signed-id verifier's serializer CAN, so the id goes in verbatim as
# `data` and `exp` is OMITTED ENTIRELY when there is none. Both measured
# against campfire under Rails 8.2, minting through the app's own
# `signed_id` and `CookieJar.build` — not through a hand-assembled
# `MessageVerifier`, which produces a third shape no app ever emits and
# which this file was pinned to for a while.
#
# The `_rails` envelope is `use_message_serializer_for_metadata`, a 7.1
# default, and it is INSIDE the signed payload — the digest covers the
# base64 text, not the JSON.
#
# Rails uses two different digests, which is the one thing here most
# likely to look like a bug:
#
#   signed cookies   HMAC-SHA1    (`signed_cookie_digest || "SHA1"`, and
#                                 no load_defaults version sets
#                                 `cookies_digest` — 8.2 included)
#   signed ids       HMAC-SHA256  (`use_legacy_signed_id_verifier` is
#                                 `:generate_and_verify` by default, and
#                                 that path passes digest: "SHA256")
#
# Salts are Rails' defaults: "signed cookie" for the cookie jar,
# "active_record/signed_id" for signed ids. An app that overrides
# `config.action_dispatch.signed_cookie_salt` or `cookies_digest` would
# need those lifted at ingest; none of the corpus does.
