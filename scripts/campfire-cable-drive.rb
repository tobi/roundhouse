# The two-connection fan-out walk: sign in, open two /cable sockets,
# subscribe both through the app's own channel, post a message, and
# require that BOTH sockets receive the turbo-stream frame.
#
# #71 item 5 ("POST -> after_commit -> fan-out reaches a second
# connection") plus the halves of items 3 and 4 that only a real socket
# can show. `tests/overlay_cable_*.rb` drive the runtime directly and are
# the fast feedback; this drives the EMITTED TREE over TCP, which is the
# only place the pieces meet — a cookie the app signed, a stream name the
# app's own view minted, a channel the app's own initializer prepended a
# guard onto, and a fragment the app's own partial rendered.
#
# THAT DISTINCTION IS NOT ACADEMIC. `undefined method 'current_user=' for
# an instance of ApplicationCable::Connection` survived a green unit test
# and a green suite, because the unit fixture carried campfire's SOURCE —
# which has the `identified_by :current_user` line that ingest drops. The
