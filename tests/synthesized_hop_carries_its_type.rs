//! A hop a LOWERING synthesizes must carry its own type.
//!
//! Three passes rewrite one call into a CHAIN, and each of them typed
//! only the outermost link. The hop underneath was built with a bare
//! `Expr::new` — `ty: None` — and no analyzer ever runs again to fill
//! it in, so `analyze::diagnose`'s rule ("receiver typed, result not")
//! fired on a send the pass had just written itself:
//!
//! * `lower::exists_conditions` — `Ban.exists?(ip_address: ip)` becomes
//!   `Ban.where(…).exists?`. The outer `exists?` carried `Bool`; the
//!   `where` under it carried nothing, and the ledger read `no known
//!   method where on Class(Ban)`, naming the one method every model has.
//! * `lower::config_reader` — `Rails.configuration.x.vapid.public_key`
//!   anchors on a synthesized `Rails.application` hop, which the stdlib
//!   registry types `Untyped` when the source writes it out longhand.
//! * `lower::including` — `xs.including(y)` becomes `xs.to_a + [y]`,
//!   and `to_a` is identity on the Array receiver it was handed.
//!
//! All three are the same rule as `lower::params_merge`'s `.to_attrs`
//! and `lower::attached`'s synthesized reader: a name the pipeline
//! writes must be a name the analyzer's world contains.
//!
//! The gates run the LOWERING and then diagnose, because that is the
//! only order in which the defect exists — analyze alone never sees
//! these nodes.
