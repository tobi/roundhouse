# Developing Roundhouse

Day-to-day reference for working on roundhouse itself — build commands,
the `roundhouse-ast` debugging tool, how the pipeline stages compose, and
the pattern for adding a new IR variant.

For deeper architecture and per-stage internals, see [`docs/`](docs/).

## Build & test

Install Rust through rustup. [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) pins
the compiler to **1.98.1** for local builds, CI and release builds; rustup
selects it automatically, including inside `wasm/`. CI also retains that
toolchain when testing generated Rust projects outside the checkout.
Upgrade the pin deliberately, after the native suite and browser WASM gates
pass. Keep the explicit WASM stack budget in `.cargo/config.toml`: the pin
is not a replacement for it. `Cargo.toml`'s `rust-version` is the minimum
supported version, not the selected build toolchain.

```bash
cargo build                        # debug build
cargo build --release              # release build
cargo build --bin roundhouse-ast   # just the CLI debug tool

cargo test                         # full default suite (unit + integration)
cargo test --test ingest           # one integration test file
cargo test --test real_blog        # the real-blog forcing functions
cargo test --lib erb::             # the ERB compiler unit tests

cargo test --test rust_toolchain -- --ignored       # real Rust build
cargo test --test typescript_toolchain -- --ignored # real TS build
# ...one <target>_toolchain per target (crystal, go, elixir, python,
# kotlin, swift, csharp, ruby, spinel, roda)

cargo test --test framework_tests_ruby -- --ignored # framework runtime's
# own test suite (runtime/ruby/test/) run against a target's transpile;
# framework_tests_{crystal,kotlin,rust,spinel,swift,typescript} likewise
```

The default test suite is the forcing function and must pass before
any commit. The test profile uses `line-tables-only` debug information:
backtraces retain file/line locations without repeating module metadata in
hundreds of integration-test binaries. Code stays unoptimized. For full
debugger information, use `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=2 cargo test`.

To separate compiler work from the emitted program's runtime, opt into phase
timings. Ruby-family emission reports assembly and text-level tree shaking
separately; timing is disabled by default:

```bash
ROUNDHOUSE_TIMINGS=1 cargo test --test emit_and_run the_unedited_blog_runs -- --nocapture
```

Toolchain and framework tests are `#[ignore]`-gated so a
local `cargo test` doesn't require every target runtime installed —
CI covers them via per-target jobs and the `smoke` matrix (which
executes each published archive's README verbatim; several toolchain
jobs were retired in its favor and remain dev-loop harnesses — see
the comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

New IR or recognizer work lands with a paired test — see [Adding a new
IR variant](#adding-a-new-ir-variant).

## Workflow runner (`bin/rh`)

`bin/rh` is the single entry point for the repository's own workflows
— the fixture, the per-target builds, the compare and bench harnesses,
the site. Ruby is the only prerequisite for the onboarding
subcommands; the build subcommands shell out to `cargo`. `bin/rh
--help` lists the surface, `bin/rh <command> --help` the options.

Onboarding (no Rust required):

- `bin/rh doctor` — check prerequisites; list which subcommands work today.
- `bin/rh fetch <target>` — download a pre-transpiled archive into `downloads/<target>/`.
- `bin/rh fixture` — generate the Rails source fixture via `rails new` + scaffold.

Build (requires Rust):

- `bin/rh transpile <target>` — build `fixtures/real-blog` into `build/transpiled-blog-<target>/`.
- `bin/rh dev | test | run <target>` — transpile, then run the emitted tree's dev/test/run action (ruby today).
- `bin/rh compare [<target>]` — fetch the same URL from Rails and the target, diff canonicalized DOM.
- `bin/rh bench [<target>...]` — HTTP throughput + RSS benchmark across targets.
- `bin/rh site` — build the full multi-target Pages site.

### Focused local verification

`bin/rh verify` is a foreground, fail-fast developer/agent loop, **not full
CI or merge approval**. It builds and runs library tests, then only the
integration and ignored toolchain suites you explicitly select. Cargo builds
the programs needed by those suites (including application binaries for
integration tests); unrelated test programs are not built. The full
`cargo build --tests` / `cargo test --all-targets` guidance above still applies
at milestones.

```sh
bin/rh verify --plan --base main --test ingest
bin/rh verify --test ingest --test real_blog
bin/rh verify --toolchain ruby --json > verification.json
bin/rh verify --test framework_tests_ruby --ignored
```

Like Cargo, default library/`--test` checks exclude `#[ignore]` tests.
An ignored-only suite therefore executes no tests by default. Use `--ignored`
with `--test` to run only its ignored tests instead; library tests remain
unchanged. `--toolchain TARGET` already selects ignored tests in
`TARGET_toolchain`. Ignored tests are never enabled implicitly: mixed suites
can contain checks requiring additional SDKs or deliberately unsupported work.

It needs Git, repository-pinned Rust, Ruby/test gems and any selected target
toolchain. Python 3 (stdlib only) is optional for the hosted-coverage preview;
planner failures are reported as unavailable and do not block local checks.
Fixtures and dependencies required by the executed tests must already be
prepared; missing fixtures are listed, but each test owns its prerequisites
and reports failures itself. The runner never installs them. `--plan`
only reads Git and the existing `scripts/ci-plan.py` policy; it does not call
Cargo, create a lock, generate Python bytecode, or execute tests.

`--base REF` compares the **current working tree** with that exact commit
(default `HEAD`), including tracked edits, deletions and untracked non-ignored
files. It does not fetch, find a merge base, or simulate GitHub's PR merge
tree. The hosted coverage selection is informational: those jobs are not
executed locally, and the planner cannot infer draft/label/full-call context.
Choose integration tests from the behavior you changed, not just file names.
Inherited Git repository-location variables are cleared for verification
subprocesses, so reports, locks and tests use this checkout rather than a
repository selected by a calling Git hook. The caller's environment is untouched.

Commands run sequentially with one Rust test thread. Cargo defaults to at
most four workers and non-incremental builds. Repository debug profiles are
left intact, including the test profile's space-saving line tables for
backtraces. Explicit Cargo environment settings are preserved, and `--jobs N`
overrides the worker count. No optimization or debug-assertion setting is changed.
Debug bench emissions and browser/DOM/corpus gates are not part of this loop.
The tool performs no cleanup, autofixes, publishing or Git writes beyond its
worktree-local verification lock. Do not run other builds/tests concurrently
in the same checkout: the lock coordinates `verify` callers, not arbitrary
Cargo commands.

Before and after execution (also after a failed check), the runner reports
available and total filesystem space for the checkout and Cargo target
directory. Cargo's offline, locked metadata resolves the target location,
including `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and Cargo configuration; a missing target directory
is measured at its nearest existing parent without creating it. The optional
probe uses POSIX `df -P -k` (Linux/macOS); missing tools or unsupported output,
including environments without `df`, are reported as unavailable and never
block tests or override their exit codes. `--plan` performs neither probe nor
Cargo metadata lookup. Less than **5 GiB** available produces an advisory
warning on stderr, not an enforced build budget or automatic cleanup.

These are filesystem snapshots, **not the size of this run's artifacts**:
other processes and shared caches affect free space. Existing artifacts are
retained; selecting fewer suites prevents unnecessary new builds but does not
remove old ones. Check disk space with your platform tools before large runs.

For a smaller build footprint, Cargo can omit symbol tables when readable
native backtraces/debugging are not needed. This is opt-in, target-dependent,
and does not change optimization, debug assertions or overflow checks. Set
both profile variables using your shell's environment syntax; POSIX example:

```sh
CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_STRIP=symbols CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_STRIP=symbols \
  bin/rh verify --test ingest --json > verification.json
```

No separate `rh` option or stripping of existing executables is needed.
Caller-supplied dev/test `DEBUG`, `STRIP` and `OPT_LEVEL` environment values are
included in `build_environment`; absent values leave Cargo configuration
alone. That report is not a complete effective Cargo configuration.
Checks that require symbolicated backtraces, including `ci_policy_workflow`,
need debug information and symbols; do not disable them for those suites.
Changing profile settings can create additional cached artifact variants;
stripping does not shrink old binaries or dependency archives. Higher
optimization can reduce artifact size but increase compile time: measure
the cold-build and repeated-run tradeoff before choosing it for a CI loop.

For an occasional package-cache reset, **first stop all builds, tests and
generated programs using it**, confirm the target directory from the report,
and do not clean a directory shared with other checkouts. Preview Cargo's
dev/test package cleanup before executing it:

```sh
cargo clean --package roundhouse --profile dev --offline --locked --dry-run --verbose
# Only after inspecting the preview, remove --dry-run to perform cleanup.
```

Use `--target-dir PATH` when necessary to identify the dedicated cache
explicitly. The default dev and test profiles share Cargo's `debug/`
output directory, so `--profile dev` covers both here. Package cleanup
retains dependency artifacts but removes Roundhouse dev/test programs,
which must be rebuilt. Do not clean after
every run: stable build settings and reuse of a dedicated cache are faster.
The verifier never performs this cleanup automatically.

`--json` sends a report to stdout and child output to stderr. The report names
HEAD, changed paths, base, build settings, each command, its exit code/time and
`passed`, `failed` or `not-run` status. `disk_space` contains before/after
snapshots in bytes or probe errors (null snapshots for a preview).
It includes the working tree but is not a content fingerprint or reusable
execution receipt; do not reuse it merely because HEAD matches.
A preview is `planned`; a failed child stops subsequent
checks and preserves its exit code. Invalid arguments or missing Git are
reported on stderr with exit 2; an unavailable Cargo command exits 127.

Cleanup: `bin/rh clean <target | fixture>`.

The working demo in two commands — a transpiled blog with articles,
comments, live Turbo Stream broadcasts over WebSocket, SQLite
persistence and Tailwind — is `bin/rh fixture` (~60s) then `bin/rh
dev ruby` (transpile + assets + serve on :3000, ~3-5 min cold).

## Fixtures

### tiny-blog

`fixtures/tiny-blog/` is the minimal always-works fixture. Its gates
run in the default suite: zero diagnostics (`tests/analyze.rs`) and
IR-shape assertions (`tests/ingest.rs`), plus per-target toolchain
gates for the absent-feature shape real-blog can't test. Checked
into the repo — safe to edit directly when extending coverage.

### real-blog

`fixtures/real-blog/` is the Phase-1 target — a modernized Rails 8
blog. It is **not checked in**; it's derived on demand from
`scripts/create-blog` (a frozen snapshot of the ruby2js upstream
generator, reproducible without an external git checkout).

```bash
bin/rh fixture          # regenerate into fixtures/real-blog/
bin/rh clean fixture    # remove it
```

The fixture is `.gitignore`d, so a fresh clone does not have it, and
neither `fixtures/store` (the Rails Guides store:
`cd fixtures && ../scripts/create-store store`). Tests reach both
through `roundhouse::fixtures::real_blog()` / `store()`, which panic
with the generating command when the directory is absent; and
`ingest_app` refuses a root that is not a directory rather than
returning an empty app, so a wrong path fails at the path, not at the
first model it cannot find.

CI prepares both fixtures in `generate-fixture` and shares this run's artifact
across unit and per-target jobs. Cache and freshness rules are documented in
[CI coverage and reuse](docs/ci-reuse.md#fixture-inputs).

`tests/real_blog.rs` pairs against the generated tree; its
load-bearing gates:

1. `ingests_without_errors` / `ingests_without_parse_diagnostics` —
   loud regression guards.
2. `type_analysis_coverage` — the contract test: zero error
   diagnostics and zero unresolved types across the whole fixture.
3. `model_tests_ingest_into_test_modules` / `fixtures_ingest_into_app`
   — the test/fixture ingest surface.

The emit-side forcing functions live in `tests/lowered_ruby_emit.rs`
and `tests/spinel_toolchain.rs` (whole-app source-equivalence
round-trip was retired in favor of compile-equivalence via Spinel —
see the header of `src/emit/ruby.rs`).

### Writebook inventory

The ignored, pinned external-corpus gate is documented in
[`docs/writebook.md`](docs/writebook.md). It inventories ingest, analysis,
lowering, Ruby/Spinel emission diagnostics, and source coverage; it is
intentionally not a compilation/runtime conformance claim.

## Debugging tools

### `roundhouse-ast`

The pipeline has four distinct stages (Prism parse → ERB compile → ingest
→ emit), and debugging almost always means "show me what stage N produced
for this input." Rust's `{:?}` Debug output isn't readable for our IR
at scale, and shelling out to `ruby --dump=parsetree` only shows Prism's
view. `roundhouse-ast` is the structural-dump tool.

Run it via `cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast --` or build once and invoke
`target/debug/roundhouse-ast` directly.

**Quick examples:**

```bash
# Default: ingest a Ruby snippet, show the IR as JSON
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- -e '[:a, :b]'

# See what Prism produced before our ingest ran
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --stage prism -e '@x.y do end'

# See the ERB compiler's Ruby output
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --stage compile-erb view.html.erb

# Emit Ruby back from one expression's IR
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --stage emit-ruby -e '"a#{x}b"'

# Run every stage in pipeline order, with headers
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --stages --erb -e '<%= x %>'

# End-to-end round-trip: ingest → emit → ingest, IR-diff on divergence
# (Ruby input only — ERB round-trip retired with the parsed-AST emitter)
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --round-trip -e '[:a, :b]'
cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --round-trip fixtures/tiny-blog/app/models/post.rb
```

**Flag reference:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-e CODE` | Inline Ruby source |
| `PATH` | Positional file (`.rb` or `.erb`; extension chooses ERB mode) |
| `--erb` | Force ERB compilation on inline input |
| `--stage NAME` | `prism`, `compile-erb`, `ingest` (default), `emit-ruby` |
| `--stages` | Run every stage, print each with a header |
| `--round-trip` | Ingest → emit → re-ingest; exit non-zero if IR diverges |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print usage |

The JSON output for IR stages uses `serde_json::to_string_pretty` on the
`Expr` type — one field per line, deterministic key ordering — which is
also why structural diffs fall out naturally when two IRs disagree.

### `dump_ir`

Dump the *lowered* IR for a fixture — what the emitters actually
consume, after analyze and the post-analyze passes. Takes a
`Class#method` selector to narrow output. When an emitter produces
wrong code, this is the first question: is the IR wrong, or the
emitter's walk of it?

```bash
cargo run --bin dump_ir -- --help
```

### `emit_preview`

Emit one target's tree from a fixture straight to disk (default
`/tmp/rh-<target>-pass2`, override with `--out`) — the fastest way to
eyeball what a change did to emitted output without `--site`
packaging. See the header of `src/bin/emit_preview.rs`.

### `roundhouse-compare`

Cross-runtime HTML equivalence check. Boot Rails on one port, boot a
roundhouse-emitted runtime on another, hand `roundhouse-compare` a URL
list, and it walks the canonicalized DOM trees side-by-side looking for
the first structural divergence. Lives in `tools/compare/` (a
standalone crate — build it there, or use `scripts/compare` which
drives the whole flow). See
[`docs/pipeline/verification.md`](docs/pipeline/verification.md).

### Round-trip debugging recipe

When `roundhouse-ast --round-trip` fails on a file or expression, it
dumps both IR JSONs and diffs them automatically — the unified diff
highlights exactly which IR fields flipped, and a one-line change in
the source is almost always a one-hunk change in the JSON. For
emit-side divergence (the lowered-IR gates in
`tests/lowered_ruby_emit.rs`), pair the failing assertion with
`dump_ir` on the same selector to see the IR the emitter was handed.

Key files:

- **`src/expr.rs`** — core `Expr` / `ExprNode`. Every new language
  feature typically lands here first.
- **`src/dialect.rs`** — Rails-level structures (`Model`, `Controller`,
  `View`, `RouteTable`, …) and the lowered `LibraryClass` /
  `LibraryFunction` contract emitters consume.
- **`src/ingest/`** — Prism → IR. `expr.rs` holds `ingest_expr`, one
  match arm per node kind; per-concern modules (model, controller,
  routes, view, …) sit alongside — `mod.rs` is the roster. Unknown
  constructs return `IngestError::Unsupported` in strict mode; survey
  mode records and continues (`src/ingest/survey.rs`).
- **`src/erb.rs` / `src/haml.rs`** — template → Ruby source string.
  Output is the input to the regular Ruby ingest path
  (`src/ingest/view.rs` is the engine seam).
- **`src/analyze/`** — type inference + effect inference. The type
  walk is `BodyTyper` in `src/analyze/body/mod.rs`; the effect walk is
  in `src/analyze/effects.rs`; `mod.rs` orchestrates the fixpoint. See
  [`docs/pipeline/analyze.md`](docs/pipeline/analyze.md).
- **`src/catalog/`** — method catalog; single source of truth for the
  AR method surface (plus the gem catalog in `gems.rs`). See
  [`docs/data/catalog.md`](docs/data/catalog.md).
- **`src/adapter.rs`** — `DatabaseAdapter` trait. See
  [`docs/data/adapter.md`](docs/data/adapter.md).
- **`src/lower/`** — target-neutral lowerings.
  `POST_ANALYZE_PASS_ORDER` in `src/lower/mod.rs` is the ordering
  authority for the post-analyze pass pipeline; the `*_to_library`
  modules produce the lowered shapes. See
  [`docs/pipeline/lower.md`](docs/pipeline/lower.md).
- **`src/emit/`** — one module per target (`<target>.rs` +
  `<target>/` submodules). Dispatch lives in
  `src/project.rs::target_files`. See
  [`docs/pipeline/emit.md`](docs/pipeline/emit.md).
- **`src/runtime_loader.rs`** — transpiles `runtime/ruby/` (the
  framework runtime) into each target at emit time.
- **`runtime/<target>/`** — hand-written per-target glue copied
  verbatim into emitted projects. See
  [`docs/pipeline/runtime.md`](docs/pipeline/runtime.md).

## Adding a new IR variant

The pattern today (example: adding `ExprNode::Array`):

1. **Declare the variant.** Add to `src/expr.rs`. Include any surface-
   preservation fields needed for byte-for-byte round-trip (e.g.
   `ArrayStyle` for `[:a]` vs `%i[a]` vs `%w[a]`).

2. **Ingest.** Add an arm to `ingest_expr` in `src/ingest/expr.rs`
   matching the relevant `as_*_node()`. Extract surface-preservation
   fields from location bytes when needed.

3. **Analyze.** Add cases in both `BodyTyper::compute`
   (`src/analyze/body/mod.rs`, the type walk) and `visit_effects`
   (`src/analyze/effects.rs`, the effect walk). Omit either at
   your peril — missing effect propagation is a silent bug.

4. **Emit.** Add a match arm in each live emitter's expression module
   (`src/emit/ruby/expr.rs`, `src/emit/typescript/expr.rs`,
   `src/emit/rust/expr/`, …). Ruby's arm must invert the ingest —
   that's what `roundhouse-ast --round-trip` checks; other targets can
   be approximations until a fixture sharpens them.

5. **Test.** Add a unit test to `tests/ingest.rs` (one `parse_one`
   helper call per surface form you claim to preserve). Run
   `cargo test --test ingest`. If the new variant appears in
   tiny-blog, its zero-diagnostics and IR-shape gates will also
   catch regressions automatically.

6. **Verify.** `cargo run --bin roundhouse-ast -- --round-trip -e 'EXAMPLE'`
   should print `ok: IR stable across …`.

**Common traps:**

- Forgetting to add the match arm in `visit_effects` — code compiles
  (it's a catch-all match), effects silently don't propagate.
- Normalizing source detail at ingest (e.g. stripping `%i[…]` style)
  silently rewrites the author's spelling on emit. Keep a distinct IR
  field for anything that would diverge — that's what the
  surface-preservation fields on `Expr` exist for.
- Emit-side parens: `emit_send_base` respects `parenthesized` for both
  implicit-self and explicit-receiver calls — don't regress this.
- Adjacent text chunks in ERB must stay merged across comment tags;
  `compile_erb` buffers `pending_text` and only flushes on meaningful
  tags. Bypass at your peril.

## Repo map

Beyond `src/` and `tests/`, the directories a newcomer will meet:

- **`src/bin/`** — seven binaries: `roundhouse` (the main CLI:
  `--target` / `--site`), `roundhouse-ast`, `roundhouse-check`,
  `roundhouse-lsp` and `roundhouse-mcp` (the inference engine's LSP
  and MCP servers), `dump_ir`, `emit_preview`.
- **`runtime/`** — per-target primitive runtimes plus `runtime/ruby/`,
  the framework runtime transpiled into every target (and its own
  test suite under `runtime/ruby/test/`).
- **`fixtures/`** — `tiny-blog/` (checked in), `real-blog/`
  (generated; see above), `roda-blog/` (the experimental Roda target's
  fixture).
- **`tools/compare/`** — standalone crate: the `roundhouse-compare`
  DOM/JSON differ.
- **`scripts/`** — workflow scripts; the load-bearing ones are
  `create-blog`, `compare`, `bench`, `smoke` (executes published
  archives' READMEs verbatim — a CI contract), `e2e`, and the
  `campfire-*` / `lobsters-*` conformance harnesses.
- **`e2e/`** — Playwright specs for the dynamic behavior a static DOM
  diff can't reach (see `e2e/README.md`); `tests/browser_smoke/` is
  the browser-side smoke harness.
- **`wasm/`** — a second crate: the compiler built for WebAssembly,
  plus the in-browser playground / IDE / studio surfaces.
- **`editors/vscode/`** — VS Code extension wrapping `roundhouse-lsp`.
- **`kotlin-reference/` / `swift-reference/`** — hand-written
  reference apps that served as forcing functions for those emitters
  (see their READMEs).
- **`site/`** — static assets for the GitHub Pages site; `bench/` —
  benchmark harness inputs.
